Super_Bowl_50 was an american_football game. Super_Bowl_50 was to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American_Football_Conference's (AFC) champion, Denver_Broncos, defeated the National_Football_Conference's (NFC) champion, Carolina_Panthers, by 24_10 to earn AFC third Super_Bowl title. As Super_Bowl_50 was the 50th Super_Bowl, the league emphasized the 'golden anniversary' with various gold_themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super_Bowl with roman_numerals, under the tradition the game would have been known as Super_Bowl_L, so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic_numerals_50. The game was played on February 7 2016, at Levis_Stadium, in the San_Francisco_Bay_Area, at Santa_Clara in California.
