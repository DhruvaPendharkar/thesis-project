Geology has three major types of rocks namely, igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock_cycle is an important concept in geology, which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock, and magma. When a rock crystallizes from magma or lava, the rock is an igneous rock. This rock can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives the rock a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock may also be re-eroded and redeposited, and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism. All three types of rocks may be re-melted. When the rocks are melted, a new magma is formed, from the magma an igneous_rock may once again crystallize.
