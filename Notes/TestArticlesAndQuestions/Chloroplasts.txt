Chloroplasts's main role is to conduct photosynthesis, where the photosynthetic pigment, chlorophyll, captures the energy from sunlight and converts the energy, and stores the energy in the energy-storage molecules, ATP and NADPH, while freeing oxygen from water. Chloroplasts then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from carbon_dioxide in a process known as the Calvin_Cycle. Chloroplasts carry out a number_of_functions, like fatty_acid_synthesis, amino_acid_synthesis, and the immune_response in plants. The number_of_chloroplasts, per cell, varies from 1 in algae, up_to 100 in plants such as Arabidopsis and wheat.
		
Q1. What is the primary purpose of chloroplasts?
?- event(E1, be, main_role, _), event(E2, V, S, O), _relation(E1, E2, _clcomplement).
