Once upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a heavy meal, the lion was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there came a mouse and the mouse started to play on the lion. Suddenly the lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed the lion's nice sleep. Then the lion saw a small mouse standing trembling with fear. The lion jumped on the mouse and started to kill the mouse. The mouse requested the lion to forgive the mouse. The lion felt pity and left the mouse. The mouse ran away. On another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net. Thus the lion escaped. There after, the mouse and the lion became friends. The lion and the mouse lived happily in the forest afterwards.
