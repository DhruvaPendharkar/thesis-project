1. Process mwe - multiword expressions
Multi-word expressions should not be processed in the normal way and should be
ignored things like such as, according to, as soon as, these things are not to be
played with

2. Process mwe - (such as)
Incase of the multi-word expressions such as "such-as", we get more insight into the 
relation of concept example where the sentence can go like rivals such as Facebook...
So here _is(rival, facebook), favorite information such as movies which becomes 
_is(information, movies)

3. team(team), branch(branch) ... or basically for X(X)
Although this is true, is it really a correct assumption and a required fact.
Test this theory and mostly it just gives no real information although it seems
a fact.

4. Parts of dates (19_feb_1990)
So here you need to divide the different parts of the date into its various components.
day(19), month(feb), year(1990) as now this is more intereseting

5. Adjectives and Modifiers for _possess(X, P) and _property(X, Y)
So better answers can be given with the help of adjectives and other modifiers like
numerical qualifiers so _possess(table, leg), _possess(table, 4_leg) etc.. etc..

6. Different properties and information wont go together, need to annotate properties
with event ids -- important problem how to give event ids to properties and possessions
For example give me a branch of computer science and lets say that the information given
is something like branch(geometry), branch(computational_complexity), 
_is(4, branch, computational_complexity), _is(6, branch, geometry)
_property(4, branch, of(computer_science))
So its only the event id that will keep things sane.
