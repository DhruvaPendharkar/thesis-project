INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — A woman was arrested at Walmart after a deputy said she rang up more than $1,800 worth of electronics for $3.70 in the self-checkout Monday.
Cheyenne Amber West, 25, of Fort Pierce, was charged with felony grand theft and felony shoplifting, according to her arrest affidavit.A loss prevention officer at Walmart, in the 5500 block of State Road 60, told a deputy he saw West and another woman select a computer, video game controllers and other merchandise from the electronics department.

"I am just trying to get gifts for my son that I cannot afford. The computer is for my husband.

'Heartless': Thieves steal Lawrence family's handicap van wheels
LAWRENCE, Mass. - A family in Lawrence was targeted by thieves once again after having the wheels on their wheelchair accessible van stolen and leaving them stranded. 
Heecliff Delarosa couldn't believe his eyes when he went outside on Sunday morning to find all four tires of his family's van had been stolen.
"So I go outside and the first thing I see is two red crates on one side and then I go on the other side and there's two more red crates no tires, no wheels," Delarosa said.
Delarosa says his family just bought the van three months ago, and it wasn't an easy purchase. 
"It's extremely expensive," Delarosa said.
The van is handicapped accessible for his 14-year-old son Isaiah who has cerebral palsy. Now, without wheels, he's stuck at home. 
"There's no other way we can transport him anywhere," Delarosa said. 
Delarosa says its bad enough to steal someone's tires, but it's even worse in this case when you can clearly see the vehicle is wheelchair accessible

Florida deputy, accused of stealing from deceased man's home, resigns from department
A sheriff’s deputy in Florida, who was arrested after getting caught on video stealing from a deceased man’s home, reportedly resigned Wednesday night.
Palm Beach Sheriff’s Deputy Jason Cooke quit his position in the department after being charged with burglary and grand theft with a firearm and spending 30 days in a drug rehabilitation facility, WPEC reported.Cooke was caught on home surveillance video lurking around the home of Moe Rosoff, an 85-year-old man who had injured himself during a blackout in Hurricane Irma, and later died at a hospital. Rosoff’s family said they asked authorities on Sept. 12 to do a welfare check on their father, who was braving the storm alone. Three deputies found the elderly man on the floor of his home and brought him to the hospital before he eventually died.

They alleged that the deputy learned how to access the home from communications on his patrol radio and later ransacked their father’s house, stealing money, jewelry and medication.

Unbeknownst to the suspect, surveillance cameras at the house turned on when he entered. The family later saw the video and turned it over to the police on Sept. 20.

Following Cooke’s eventual admittance of the crime, he was allowed to enter a drug rehab program before he was arrested, leading the family to believe he received special treatment through his connections on the forceThey also argued that he “posed a significant threat to the public’s safety” because an investigation of his patrol car produced several types of medication, including some that the family said their father did not take and suggested that this was possibly not the first crime he’d committed.

“In our opinion, had we not had this video, this cop would still be out there posing a threat of danger to the community he swore to protect and committing more crimes,” the family said in a statement. “It is our hope that the justice system treats this cop like any other criminal out there and that he doesn't receive further preferential treatment because he is a police officer.”

The sheriff’s office responded to the charges saying, “Unfortunately sometimes an employee makes a bad decision which leads to misconduct.”

As of Tuesday, Cooke had been placed on paid administrative leave.

Utah woman caught rifling through wallet of man having seizure at 7-Eleven
A woman in Utah turned herself in to police after she was caught on video going through a man’s wallet -- and taking his credit card -- while he was having a seizure in a 7-Eleven convenience store.
Alexandra Dewsnup, 28, was arrested on charges of unlawful possession of a credit card and felony theft and booked in the Salt Lake County Jail, Fox 13 reported Wednesday.Surveillance video from Oct. 4 showed Dewsnup standing near the register of the 7-Eleven rifling through the victim’s wallet while he was lying on the floor having a seizure.She continued to search the wallet before taking out one of the man’s credit cards and stuffing it under her arm. She then put the wallet back in his pocket and walked away.
Police said the stolen credit card was later used to buy something online, according to Fox 13.
Dewsnup reportedly turned herself in and told investigators that she'd taken Xanax at the time of the robbery, but held herself accountable for her actions. Some of her relatives were among the people who sent tips to police, the report added.The man, Dustin Malone, told the news station he has epilepsy, which triggers the seizures, but he doesn’t typically have them in public.
“I go completely stiff, my eyes go back, I lose consciousness and I collapse,” Malone said.
He said he called the police after he came out of the seizure and discovered he’d been robbed.
Malone, a certified nursing assistant, said, “Nothing irritates me more, as a health care provider, than people who victimize other people.”

Surveillance video catches thieves hugging excitedly after finding money in an unlocked car
A group of thieves couldn’t help but hug after they reportedly found hundreds of dollars in an unlocked car in Virginia.

Surveillance video caught the looters checking several cars in Henrico County early Tuesday morning, Fox 8 reported. When one of the men found the money, he appeared to show the others before they could be seen dancing and jumping around, evidently pleased with their findings.A woman who lives in the area said her daughter-in-law accidentally left her car unlocked that evening and discovered that her rent money had been stolen out of her purse, Fox 8 reported.Retired Henrico Deputy Christopher Wilson told WTVR that seeing the video “made his blood boil” and that the men involved needed to be taught “some manners” and to “respect other people’s property.”
Wilson reportedly felt guilty because he thought he heard a noise at the time of the incident, but didn’t go check on it.
He said the community has faced similar looting problems sporadically over the last three years but judging by the video, the thieves don’t care, WTVR reported.
“Go to work, come home and you can’t have peace at home because somebody’s invading your privacy,” he said.
Residents in the area have reportedly started locking up their outdoor belongings more securely following the robbery.

Bizarre $1.2 million fajitas theft scheme leads to arrest
A Texas man was charged with felony theft after investigators linked him to an odd plot to steal more than $1.2 million worth of fajitas over nine years, the Brownsville Herald reported.

Former Cameron County Juvenile Justice Department employee Gilberto Escaramillo missed work one day in August for a medical appointment, the same day a delivery driver called the kitchen about having 800 pounds of fajitas to drop off, the paper said. A woman informed the driver that the juvenile department didn't serve the Tex-Mex food - but the driver said he'd been delivering it for nine years, Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz told the Herald. 

“When Mr. Escaramilla reports to work the next day, he is confronted with the discussion and he admits he had been stealing fajitas for nine years,” Saenz said. 

Escaramilla was fired that month and arrested after investigators obtained a search warrant and found packages of the Tex-Mex food in his refrigerator, Saenz explained.  

They also checked invoices and determined he would intercept county-funded food deliveries and deliver them to his own customers, according to the newspaper. 

He was determined to have stolen $1,251,578 of fajitas, the report added. Escaramilla was arrested last week on a felony theft charge.

“If it wasn’t so serious, you’d think it was a Saturday Night Live skit. But this is the real thing,” Saenz said.

FBI hunts person who stole ATM van, $1.8 million from Georgia bank

Authorities are hunting a person who snagged $1.8 million after stealing an ATM courier van from a Georgia bank.

The FBI released a grainy photo Wednesday of the person they said stole a white courier van outside a Citizens Trust Bank in DeKalb County earlier this month.

Special Agent Stephen Emmett told FOX5 Atlanta that two couriers from ATM Response Inc. were servicing the bank on Sept. 8 around 6:45 a.m.In accordance with company policy, the employees left the vehicle running with the keys in the ignition and the doors locked.

When they returned to the van about 15 minutes later, they noticed glass from the passenger side window on the ground and the vehicle missing, authorities said.“Someone that has just come into $1.8 million might be talking about it, might be buying things, might be sharing his wealth,” Emmett said.

Camera footage from inside the ATM room in the bank showed a person in dark pants, a baggy gray long-sleeve shirt and a black backpack approach the vehicle. The person is seen pulling on the driver’s side door and then the passenger’s side door.

The stolen van was spotted a short time later, about a mile and a half from the bank -- but the cash was gone.

The FBI is asking local residents who might have seen something to call police or crime stoppers 404-577-TIPS.

Notorious 'granny gem thief' released from jail, but could still faces legal trouble
The infamous international “granny gem thief” who's stolen millions of dollars worth of items during a nearly eight-decade criminal career was released from jail Friday -- but her recent shoplifting troubles may still linger.
Doris Payne, 86, was released from DeKalb County jail, just outside of Atlanta, after she was arrested for allegedly shoplifting $86.22 worth of items at a Chamblee Walmart in July, her lawyer Drew Findling said Monday.

Payne’s case is still pending and she may face further time for her misdemeanor shoplifting charge. She's due back in court in October, but her lawyers believe she is trouble-free, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

“There was not enough new evidence on the new arrest,” her other attorney, Marissa Goldberg, said. “She’s free.”

Payne told WGCL-TV after her court hearing on Friday: “They didn’t have anything to prove…I never lied and didn’t say I didn’t have it. I’m saying there was no intent. And there wasn’t.”At the time of her Walmart arrest, the granny thief was amid a three-year probation stint after pleading guilty to another shoplifting charge in March. During that incident, Payne had attempted to steal a $2,000 necklace from a store at Perimeter Mall in December. She was banned from every Atlanta-area mall after the incident, Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

The judge closed her probation violation case last week after determining there wasn’t enough evidence to keep her in jail.

Payne's rap sheet details more than 20 arrests in the span of 76 years. She's mostly served short sentences for her crimes and has sometimes been released for good behavior – before ultimately ending up back behind bars.

Payne appeared in a 2013 documentary, “The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne,” in which she detailed the first time she "took" a piece of jewelry at age 10. Payne also talked about how she took her thieving ways abroad, to locales such as Greece, Switzerland and France.

"There's never been a day that I went to steal that I did not get what I went to do," Payne said in the documentary.

15-pound pet pig Spam 'pignapped' during break-in

Cleveland police are looking for Spam.

The ironically-named 15-pound mini pet pig was taken during a home break-in Monday, officials said.

“It’s just sad somebody would do this,” owner Valerie Couch told News 5 Cleveland. “My guess is they just want to sell him and make money. But you know. He’s part of our family. Keep the electronics, but don’t take somebody’s pet.”
She said she has owned the 1-year-old mini pig since he was just a piglet.

“He’s a spitfire, so he’s probably driving somebody crazy right now,” Couch said. “So just bring him back to his home where we can take care of him the right way.”

Couch’s dog and cat were left safely inside the home.

Couch posted about the theft on Facebook.

Police said they are investigating the incident, adding the thief entered via a back window that had been popped open and removed. Jewelry, TVs and a camera were also stolen.

Couch said on Facebook a neighbor told police she saw an unfamiliar tall, thin man – aged 18 to 21 – exit a black two-door vehicle that was backed in front of their home.

'Boomer and Carton' co-host Craig Carton arrested by FBI in alleged ticket scheme
The FBI arrested a New York sports radio talk show host at his Manhattan home Wednesday for alleged involvement in running a fake ticket scheme.

Man tied to $500M art heist to be sentenced in separate case
A reputed Connecticut mobster who authorities say is the last surviving person of interest in the largest art heist in U.S. history is set to be sentenced on unrelated weapons convictions.

Robert "The Cook” Gentile is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in federal court in Hartford.

Prosecutors have said they believe the 81-year-old Manchester resident has information about the still-unsolved 1990 heist at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.

Thieves stole an estimated $500 million worth of artwork, including works by Rembrandt, Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas and Johannes Vermeer.

The mobster plead guilty in April in connection with the seizure of firearms and ammunition from his home by federal agents. The plea deal calls for him to serve three to six years in prison.Gentile was indicted after authorities say they seized a .22-caliber Browning semi-automatic pistol and several other weapons during a May 2016 search of his Manchester property.

FBI officials first identified Gentile in April 2015 as the last surviving person of interest in the Gardner heist, in which two men posing as police officers stole 13 pieces of artwork including paintings by Rembrandt van Rijn, Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas and Johannes Vermeer. No one has been charged in the art theft, and the paintings have never been found.

When federal agents searched Gentile's house in Manchester in 2012, they found a handwritten list of the stolen paintings and their estimated worth, according to prosecutors, who also said a polygraph test showed there was a 99 percent chance that Gentile was lying when he denied knowing where the paintings were.

Convinced that he still had information related to the heist, Feds searched his home again in May 2016 but came up empty handed with evidence related to the case but found his cache of weapons.

Gentile has continually denied knowing anything about the theft.Nearly three decades later, an investigator independently working the case said he's "100 percent convinced" the most valuable collection of stolen artwork is somewhere in Ireland, specifically in the possession of associates with the Irish Republican Army, or the IRA.

"I have been talking with several former IRA members -- individuals I've built a trust with over the years," art investigator Arthur Brand told Fox News in July.

"I'm convinced they are there," Brand said of the artworks. "The Ireland angle has been one of the most promising leads from the beginning."

It was just after midnight on March 18, 1990, two men dressed as police officers buzzed the side door at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston and claimed they were there to investigate a disturbance.

A little more than an hour later, the men left with a collection of artwork valued at around half-a-billion dollars -- 13 masterpieces including Rembrandt's only seascape, "The Storm on the Sea of Galilee," and Vermeer's "The Concert," a masterpiece said to be worth more than $200 million.

The thieves also snatched an ancient Chinese bronze beaker or "Ku" from the Shang Dynasty and a finial that once stood atop a flag from Napoleon's Army.

The suspects, described as white men in their 30s, convinced two inexperienced security guards that they were police officers responding to a call, before overtaking the guards and tying them up. They spent 81 minutes inside the museum, walking the dark hallways before making their way to the Dutch Room, where the most valuable works were found.

Facebook selfies with stolen guns lead to arrest of teen in gun shop smash and grab

A Colorado teenager faced charges last week after the feds say he posted photos of himself with stolen guns on Facebook.

Viet Trinh, 18, of Thornton, is accused of being part of a smash-and-grab burglary ring that targeted gun shops in the Denver area, according to reports.

“Know anyone that wants to buy a baby .40? $300,” Trinh messaged friends on Facebook on Nov. 11, the day after thieves broke into a Thornton gun shop and stole 25 guns, the Denver Post reported Thursday.

“I got my 9? wit (sic) full clips,” Trinh wrote on Dec. 20, the paper reported, citing federal court papers. “Mixed with poison hallows, regular hallows and strait meadle (sic) jackets.”

The court papers say that when asked by text where he got the weapon, Trinh texted, “A yistol (sic) shop,” according to the paper reported.

Trinh was arrested Aug. 16 and, during an interview with Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives agents, he admitted to being the getaway driver in the Thornton smash and grab.

He also said that he sold one of the guns he got from the burglary for $375, Fox 31 Denver reported.

An informant told agents Trinh was offering the stolen guns on Facebook under another name.

“Stupid people do stupid things, and that’s why they get caught. And that is a prime example,” Jacob McIntosh, a worker at the South Platte Tactical gun shop in Brighton, told CBS 4 Denver.

McIntosh says agents recovered some of the guns stolen from his store after Trinh was arrested, according to the station.

Trinh is a suspect in another break-in and is also accused of helping burglars who were involved in other smash and grabs, the station reported.

Trinh was charged Tuesday in Denver federal court with theft from the inventory of a federal firearms licensee and faces up to 10 years in prison, if convicted.

Burglars ram stolen truck into Louisiana convenience store in ATM heist


Louisiana police are hunting for several burglars who decided to use a stolen white pickup truck as a battering ram to steal an ATM from a convenience store -- an incident caught on surveillance tape.

Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office released the video on Tuesday of the white truck plowing into the storefront of Brother's Food Mart in Metairie on Aug. 19, WDSU reported.Several men were seen jumping out of the vehicle and attempting to pull the ATM off the ground, without success. 

The driver then drove the vehicle back into the store, ramming the machine to loosen it up enough for the burglars to dump it in the back of the truck.

Couple exploited Lowe's website glitch to steal, resell items, authorities say

A New Jersey couple was arrested after allegedly exploiting a glitch in the website for Lowe’s home improvement stores to steal and then resell online more than $250,000 worth of items, authorities said.

Kimy Velazquez, 40, and Romela Velazquez, 24, of Brick Township, were charged Tuesday with theft, fraud and computer criminal activity. Law enforcement officials alleged that they exploited a gap in the store’s website that enabled them to have merchandise shipped to their home without making payment. Investigators who executed a search warrant on their home earlier this month said authorities recovered enough stolen merchandise to fill an 18-foot trailer.

“Detectives on scene stated the residence resembled more of a warehouse than a home,” reads a statement released by the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office.

Some of the bigger ticket items – many of which were still in the box -- recovered by police included:

A stainless steel Weber grill
An aluminum gazebo
One Honda lawn mower
An LG portable air conditioner
A Dewalt Power Washer
Multiple boxes of Ugg boots
A 70” Vizio LED smart TV
A Sony stereo surround sound system with 4 speakers
One Nikon D5000 camera
Three Dyson Ball vacuum cleaners
Multiple boxes of disassembled furniture
Approximately $2,500 worth of Victoria’s Secret underwear
The prosecutor alleges that Romela Velazquez exploited weaknesses in the Lowe’s website in order to have merchandise shipped to the home, then allegedly posted several of the stolen merchandise items to a local Facebook group “Buy and Sell” page, often listing the items as “New in Box” and for less than half their regular retail price.

Romela Velazquez has been charged with computer criminal activity for accessing a computer system with the purpose to defraud, second degree theft by deception for attempting to obtain merchandise totaling approximately $258,068.01 (pre-tax) and third degree theft by deception for receipt of merchandise without payment.

Kimy Velazquez was charged with receipt of stolen property and fencing. He was released on a summons pending a future court date while Romela Velazquez was taken into custody pending a future court date.

Investigators are checking whether the couple replicated the alleged plan via other retailers' websites, which may result in additional charges.

Witnesses reported the tattooed man “acting differently” as he paced around the business.An employee said Breaker took food off the shelves and ate it before he leapt over the pharmacy’s counter and pulled a knife out of his pocket.

The man then tried to break open a door with a fire extinguisher but gave up and exited through the front entrance.   Witnesses were able to describe the man due to his noticeable face tattoo that resembles a clown. Breaker was also wanted in California for auto theft. The day after the robbery, he was reported missing, authorities said.

The suspect has been held without bond on a “second-degree felony count of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon,” according to ABC13.

Texas store clerks wrestle two armed men in attempted robbery captured on video

Two employees of a cell phone store in Texas fought off two would-be robbers and chased them away believing the crooks were holding fake weapons – but a gun left behind and found at the scene was fully loaded, police said.

Authorities are now looking for the two men who tried to rob the store.

Arlington police said the two suspects entered Z-Comm store on July 18 claiming they had phones to sell, but instead pulled a gun on the clerks inside.

Khurrum Monga and his son, Haris, told Fox 4 News they immediately noticed the two young men entering the store because they were overly dressed for the sweltering, 100-degree day.

Surveillance video shows the one of the suspects jump on the counter demanding things from the two clerks. The clerks fought back.The Mongas later realized the men were holding real guns.

Steven Bartolotta of the Arlington Police Department said he was glad no one was hurt, but recommended that people should not challenge armed gunmen.

“You do need to try to defend yourself in any way possible,” he said, “but this is not something we recommend because you cannot replace your life.”

Police released the surveillance footage in hopes the public can identify the two robbers.

Texas robbery suspect found asleep at the scene, cops say

For one Texas man, the saying, "You snooze, you lose" rings true. 

Robbery suspect Kanyoni Sedekiya, 20, was arrested after he was found dozing at the scene, according to Abilene investigators. 

A police statement posted on Facebook said that early Friday morning "just before 4 a.m. police were called to a robbery in progress."

Alleged tortoise thief turns himself in

The hunt for a New York tortoise thief appeared to have come to an end Tuesday after a Queens man turned himself in to police a month after the beloved reptile was stolen from an environmental center, officials said.

Shawn Waters, 36, turned himself in after allegedly stealing the 100-pound African spurred tortoise named "Millennium," the New York Post reported. The tortoise disappeared from the Alley Pond Environmental Center in Little Neck on July 17. 

Waters' mother, Amy, however, said she believes the media is blowing her son's case "out of proportion." She told the New York Daily News on Wednesday that Waters "love animals."

"That’s his passion. And now they’re trying to create him like he’s some kind of monster on the news? Like, come on," she said. "They’re trying to blow this thing out of proportion, and I think this is getting really ridiculous now. I mean, come on now — let’s stop the circus."The mother questioned how nobody noticed her son taking a massive 17-year-old tortoise out of the center."A 100-pound turtle ... If he took it on the bus or something, wouldn’t somebody notice that?” she said. "That turtle was huge. So that’s another thing that’s odd, because this is a huge a-- turtle from what I saw."

The tortoise thief remained a mystery until police received a call on July 24 from a Connecticut man saying he unknowingly bought a stolen tortoise from Waters, The New York Post reported. The two men allegedly met at a train station in Fairfield and traded Millennium for $300 and a musk turtle.

The Connecticut man, who was not identified, then realized the prized animal he just purchased was stolen after hearing media reports, officials said. He called police and the tortoise was returned last week.

Homeless man robbed bank so he could go back to prison

A Nevada homeless man claims he robbed a bank so he could seek refuge in prison.

Tommy Ray McAdoo, 78, confessed to committing a bank robbery in order to be sent back to prison. He will be sentenced in federal court Tuesday in Reno, NV and faces up to 25 years behind bars.

"In large part, Mr. McAdoo simply wanted to get out of the cold and return to prison," his lawyer said.

His public defenders are asking for leniency in the case and are requesting a sentence of less than five years.

“Mr. McAdoo's crime was committed by a gravely ill, homeless man, who, after staying out of the system for eight years, impulsively decided he needed to do something to go back to prison," federal public defenders Rene Valladares and Lauren Gorman wrote in court papers filed July 25.

The robbery occurred in the fall of 2016 when McAdoo walked into a bank in downtown Reno holding a steak knife and demanded money, writing his demand on the back of a casino sports betting sheet. He made off with more than $2,000.

His public defender initially entered a not guilty plea directly after the crime, but McAdoo later pleaded guilty to bank robbery with the use of a deadly weapon.

McAdoo has a long criminal, history having been convicted on at least five different robbery charges since 1964.
