Nintendo said on Thursday that Nintendo would soon terminate Nintendo smartphone_app Miitomo, which gained attention as the game_makers_initial_foray into the smartphone business, because Miitomo failed to attract enough players. A nintendo_spokesman said that, the decision was made to streamline Nintendo resources to other smartphone_apps. The number of active users of the game has been declining. Miitomo, which Nintendo introduced globally in March 2016, features the company Mii avatar_system and lets users communicate by exchanging personal information such as favorite movies. Though the company described Miitomo as a game_app, analysts and players viewed Miitomo more as a social-networking service and Miitomo failed to gain users from larger rivals such as Facebook_Inc. Kyoto-based Nintendo said the free-to-play app_service would end on May 9. The app was a failure since Mittomo's early stage and Hideki_Yasuda had been saying that, Nintendo should shut down the service as soon as possible, said Hideki_Yasuda, an analyst at Ace_Research_Institute. Hideki_Yasuda said that, without a large number of active users, users would use the app daily, this kind of service is not attractive. Besides Miitomo, Nintendo has introduced Super_Mario_Run, Fire_Emblem_Heroes and Animal_Crossing_Pocket_Camp as game_apps for smartphone users. Super_Mario_Run, Fire_Emblem_Heroes and Animal_Crossing_Pocket_Camp have had more success than Miitomo, but the smartphone business has yet to become a major revenue_generator for Nintendo. Company executives say that, the executives view smartphone games as a way of attracting customers, customers may later try out Nintendo machines such as the Switch.
